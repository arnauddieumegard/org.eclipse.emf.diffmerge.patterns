# Contributing to EMF Diff/Merge

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse EMF Diff/Merge is a diff/merge tool for models. Its main purpose is to
help build higher-level tools that need to merge models based on consistency
rules. GUI components are also provided. Typical usages include model
refactoring, iterative model transformations, bridges between models or modeling
tools, collaborative modeling environments, or versioning systems.
