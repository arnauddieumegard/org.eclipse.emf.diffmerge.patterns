	<BR> Before clicking “Create pattern…”, the user needs to select model elements. It is often convenient to operate in a diagram for that purpose; however, a diagram may not show all the elements needed. Conversely, using the Project Explorer allows the user to select all the elements he wants, but this operation can be cumbersome.<BR>
	<BR> As a solution, it is possible to use the following menu items.<BR>
	<BR> <LI> “Include in patterns”: mark the elements as selected (in a diagram or in the Project Explorer) for pattern creation. When the Pattern Creation wizard is being opened, these elements will appear together with those that are actually selected.</LI><BR>
	<BR> <LI> “Reset inclusions”: cancel the effect of the menu item above. Only the elements which are actually selected will appear in the Pattern Creation wizard.</LI><BR>
