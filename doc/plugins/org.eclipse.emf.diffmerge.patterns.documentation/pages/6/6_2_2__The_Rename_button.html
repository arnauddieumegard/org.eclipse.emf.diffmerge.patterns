	<BR> The Rename button allows users to customize the names of instance elements by adding a prefix and/or a suffix to the original names from the pattern 
	(see <A HREF="../../pages/5/5_2__Wizard_page_2_Role_mapping.html"> section 'Wizard page 2: Role mapping'</A> for a description of what the text field should contain). If the name of an element has been manually edited by the user, it will remain unchanged if the 'Keep user names' check box is ticked, otherwise it will be synchronized with the name defined by the pattern.<BR>
