	<BR> The “Show” button allows showing all instance elements in the current diagram, whenever possible. It is equivalent to manually using the tools of the diagram for “inserting” the elements of the instance.<BR>
	<BR> This feature is typically useful when a pattern has been applied in a diagram (e.g. a Functional Breakdown diagram) and the elements of the instance must be used in a different diagram (e.g. a Functional Dataflow Blank diagram).<BR>
	<BR> After the button is clicked, the “Status” text field is filled with information about the graphical nodes added in the diagram during the operation. If the diagram was not modified, the “Unchanged” message is displayed; otherwise, the number of “main” added nodes is indicated. A “main” added node is a node which is not contained by another added node.<BR>
