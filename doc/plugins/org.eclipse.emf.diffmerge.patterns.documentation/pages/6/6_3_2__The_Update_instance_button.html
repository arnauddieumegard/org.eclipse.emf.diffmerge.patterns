	<BR> The 'Update instance' button allows users to synchronize the instance with its pattern. This operation consists in adding everything in the pattern (pattern elements and references between them) which is not present in the instance. <BR>

	<UL> <BR><LI> If the 'Destructive' check box is ticked, the operation also deletes any element or reference of the instance which is not present in the pattern. The update operation is then 'destructive', by contrast with a 'conservative' update.<BR>
		<BR><LI> If the 'Show additions' check box is ticked, every element added during update is showed in the diagram, if possible. This is equivalent to clicking the 'Show' button after the 'Update instance' button 
		(see <A HREF="../../pages/6/6_4_1__The_Show_button.html"> section 'The 'Show' button'</A>).<BR>
	</UL>
	
	<BR> <B>Warning:</B> The instance update feature does not take the layout or style into account. For reusing the layout or the style of the pattern, click the 'Reuse layout' button or the 'Reset' button after checking the 'Reuse style' checkbox after the instance has been updated 
	(see <A HREF="../../pages/6/6_4_2__The_Reuse_layout_button.html"> section 'The 'Reuse layout' button'</A>).<BR>
