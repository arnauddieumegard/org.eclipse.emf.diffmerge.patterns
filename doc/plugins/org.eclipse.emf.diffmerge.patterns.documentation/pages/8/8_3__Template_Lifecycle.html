	<BR> A template is nothing more than a special kind of pattern. Consequently:<BR>
	
	<UL> <BR><LI> It has a version, authors, documentation, etc.<BR>
		<BR><LI> It can be instantiated and updated like a “normal” pattern.<BR>
		<BR><LI> It can be defined using another template.<BR>
		<BR><LI> It can be deleted from a catalog.<BR>
	</UL>
	
	<BR> Nonetheless, templates are distinguished from patterns in the UI by the "&lt;Template>" prefix. <BR>
