	<BR> Creating a pattern takes time. It involves selecting the relevant model elements, finding the missing ones via the analysis of dependencies, filling property fields, creating roles if needed, mapping elements to them and further specifying them.<BR>
	<BR> The purpose of pattern templates is to (partly) automate this process in order to simplify the creation of a set of similar patterns. The principle of template usage is to start from a single “main model element” selected by the user, collect other elements it depends upon according to certain rules, and map these elements to predefined roles in order to initialise the pattern. A template is managed similarly to a pattern: it is stored in a catalog, evolved and deleted like a pattern.<BR>
	<BR> <B>Warning:</B> the usage of templates is intended to be accessible to anyone who is familiar with patterns, but the creation of templates is a complex process for very advanced users.<BR>
