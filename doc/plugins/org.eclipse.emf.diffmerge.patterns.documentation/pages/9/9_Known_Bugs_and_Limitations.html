		<BR><LI> Catalog move/deletion. If a catalog is moved or deleted via the Project Explorer while it is open, the catalog remains open but it cannot be modified. Close it, and re-open it if it was moved, to solve the problem.<BR>
		<BR><LI> Model copy. If a project or model is copy/pasted in the Project Explorer, and both the original and the copy models are opened, then the pattern tool cannot distinguish between instance elements from the original model and instance elements from the copy. This is because model elements have the same identifiers in both models. Close one of the models to solve the problem.
		<BR><LI> Instance display. There is no systematic method for showing an instance in a diagram, as needed during pattern application or when the “Show” button is clicked in the Instance Management Panel. A heuristic method is being used that has been successfully tested in most Capella diagrams for example. However, since it is heuristic it may not always provide an optimal result. For example, when applying a pattern made of a Node PC on another Node PC in Capella, the instance is not automatically displayed. Manually show the Node PC then click the “Show” and “Reuse layout” buttons of the Instance Management Panel to correctly display the instance.<BR>
		<BR><LI> Pattern update and scope. When updating a pattern, a heuristic algorithm attempts to detect the elements that should be included in the instance in addition to the original instance elements. For example, in Capella, if a Port belongs to the instance and an Exchange is connected to the Port, the Exchange is detected together with the opposite Port. Those elements appear as “added” in the 2nd page of the Pattern Update wizard. Do not forget to remove them with the “Exclude” button if they should not belong to the instance or the pattern after update.<BR>
		<BR><LI> Pattern update and multi-part instances. When a pattern is updated from a multi-part instance (an instance whose pattern has: 1. non-unique elements and 2. OCL expressions that return collections – 
			see <A HREF="../../pages/3/3__Pattern_Creation.html"> section “Pattern Creation”</A>), modifying the scope of the instance with the “Exclude” or “Include…” menu items results in unexpected differences being shown. The combination of scope modification and multi-part instances is currently not supported.Instance update and merge: When updating a pattern instance, new elements can only be added to the model, not merged, even if they are associated with roles in the pattern.<BR>
