	<BR> The first page of the Wizard allows selecting the pattern to apply and viewing its properties and metadata. Note that the pattern is presented in read-only mode: it cannot be modified during the application process. If the catalog of the pattern cannot be found in the combo box, the catalog must be opened: just click the 'Open...' button for that purpose. <BR>

	<BR> Once a pattern has been selected, it is sometimes possible to finish the process by clicking the 'Finish' button. This corresponds to the simplest usage of patterns: patterns in 'addition' mode, i.e., pattern elements inserted in model elements in addition, not merge, mode. For complex patterns or more sophisticated pattern applications, click the 'Next' button. <BR>
