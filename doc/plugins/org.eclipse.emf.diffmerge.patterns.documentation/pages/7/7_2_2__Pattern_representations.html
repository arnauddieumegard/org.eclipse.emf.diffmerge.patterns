	<BR> The patterns used in the model are represented below the corresponding catalogs. <BR>

	<BR> If a pattern belongs to a catalog which is not open, the “<Not loaded>” mention appears in its name. Use the “Open/Browse” menu item to open the catalog of the pattern or, if the catalog is open, browse the content of the pattern 
	(see <A HREF="../../pages/4/4__Browsing_Catalogs.html"> section “The “Browsing Catalogs”</A>). The same can be achieved by double-clicking the name of the pattern.<BR>
	<BR>The “Manage instance(s)” menu item opens the Instance Management Panel on all the instances of the selected pattern(s).<BR>
