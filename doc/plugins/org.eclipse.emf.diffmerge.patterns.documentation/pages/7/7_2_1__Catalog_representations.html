	<BR> A catalog may be open or not. If not, the '<Not loaded>' mention appears in its name. Use the 'Open/Browse' menu item to open a closed catalog or browse an open catalog 
	(see <A HREF="../../pages/4/4__Browsing_Catalogs.html"> section 'The 'Browsing Catalogs'</A>). The same can be achieved by double-clicking the name of the catalog. Note that when browsing an open catalog, the user has the possibility to close it.<BR>
			
	<BR> The 'Manage instance(s)' menu item opens the Instance Management Panel on all the instances of patterns that are contained in the selected catalog(s).<BR>
