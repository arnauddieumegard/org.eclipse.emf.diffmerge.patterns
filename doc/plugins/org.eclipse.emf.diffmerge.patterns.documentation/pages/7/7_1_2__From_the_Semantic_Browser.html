	<BR> In the Capella Semantic Browser, a category named 'All Related Pattern Instances' (in the 'Current Element' section) identifies all the instances the element belongs to (see figure below). The same operation can be done on these instances as in the Instance Management Panel.	  <BR>	
	<BR> Additionally, any model element can be right-clicked and the 'Show in Pattern Instance Explorer' menu item selected as in the figure below. In that case, the Pattern Instance Explorer will focus on all the instances the model element belongs to. The same result can be obtained by selecting the model element and pressing the 'Shift+F7' key.	  <BR>
