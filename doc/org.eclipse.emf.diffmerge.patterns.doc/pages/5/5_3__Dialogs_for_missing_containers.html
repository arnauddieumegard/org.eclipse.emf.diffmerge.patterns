	<BR> If some of the roles have not been associated to model elements before the wizard was closed, additional dialogs pop up in order to complete the application of the pattern. These dialogs enforce the choice of a container for the pattern elements of the unassigned roles. The unassigned roles are thus applied by addition if they have not been explicitly applied in the Wizard page.<BR>
	<BR> Radio buttons enable the user to specify whether the selected container should apply to the 'Current element' only, to 'All similar elements' in all non-applied roles, or to 'All compatible elements' in those roles.<BR>

	<BR> The 'current element' is the pattern element mentioned in the message of the dialog. 'All similar elements' means all the elements which are of the same type as the current element. For example, if the current element is a Logical Function, then the selected container will apply to all remaining Logical Functions. 'All compatible elements' means that the selected container will apply to all remaining elements it can contain. For example, if the current element is a Logical Function and the selected container is another Logical Function, it will also become the container of every Control Node (Fork / Join / Decision) that needs a container.<BR>
	<BR> The application process can be interrupted by clicking the 'Cancel' button. In that case, the Pattern Application Wizard remains open so that the current application can be re-worked.<BR>
