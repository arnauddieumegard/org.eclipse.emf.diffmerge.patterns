	<BR> The 'Reset' button cancels the effect of the 'Highlight' button by restoring the representation of the instance to the style defined in the pattern.<BR>
	<BR> Beware that it does not restore the color settings to those before highlighting, but to those defined in the pattern. If certain graphical shapes had custom style settings, they will not get them back. In that case, you may want to use the 'Undo' feature of the modelling tool (<Ctrl-Z>) to restore the custom style of the shapes.<BR>
